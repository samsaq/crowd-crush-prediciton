# MVP Dataset Requirements for ConvLSTM Crowd Crush Model

Here's a detailed breakdown of what we need for a minimum viable dataset to train the ConvLSTM model for crowd crush prediction:

## Size and Composition

- **Total Sequences**: 50-100 distinct crowd movement sequences
- **Frames per Sequence**: 10-15 consecutive frames per sequence
- **Resolution**: Consistent resolution across all frames
- **Class Balance**: 30-40% should contain crowd crush conditions

## Data Format Requirements

1. **Input Sequence Format**:
   - Tensor shape: `(batch, seq_len, channels, height, width)`
   - Each frame represented as a density map (0-1 normalized values)
   - Single channel (grayscale) is sufficient

2. **Ground Truth Format**:
   - Binary maps indicating crush/non-crush regions
   - Same spatial dimensions as input frames
   - Can be derived from density thresholds (areas exceeding critical density)

## Essential Scenario Variations

The MVP dataset must include:

1. **Basic Scenarios** (50% of dataset):
   - Bidirectional flow in corridors
   - Four-way intersections
   - Simple room evacuation

2. **Critical Scenarios** (50% of dataset):
   - Bottleneck formations (doorways, narrowing corridors)
   - Obstacle-induced congestion
   - Counter-flow with density buildup
   - Sudden direction changes causing compression

## Environmental Variations

Include at minimum:

- 3-5 different venue layouts
- 2-3 different crowd densities per layout
- 2-3 different movement patterns per layout

Lets go for 10 scenarios total

## Camera Perspectives

- At least 2 different camera angles per venue
- Overhead view (for easier ground truth mapping) - Call it drone
- One more realistic surveillance-style angle (for real-world application) - Call it CCTV

## UMANS + ChAOS RC Implementation Steps

1. **Create Base Environments**:
   - Design 3-5 simple venue layouts in UMANS
   - Include at least one with corridors and one with an open space + obstacles

2. **Generate Crowd Movements**:
   - Configure 8-10 crowd movement patterns (bidirectional, evacuation, etc.)
   - Ensure some patterns create natural density buildups

3. **Simulation Parameters**:
   - Low density: ~1-2 agents/m²
   - Medium density: ~3-4 agents/m²
   - High density: ~5-7 agents/m² (crush-prone)
   - Vary walking speeds between 0.8-1.5 m/s

4. **Data Collection Process**:
   - Run each scenario in UMANS to generate trajectory data
   - Import trajectories into ChAOS RC for visualization
   - Capture camera views at 3-5 frames per second
   - Extract density maps from trajectory data (convert positions to 2D density)
   - Create ground truth by thresholding density (>4-5 agents/m² as crush risk)

## How to make the most of it
We also want to stretch the dataset with some simple augmentation
Eg: geometric transformations for the image and GT
